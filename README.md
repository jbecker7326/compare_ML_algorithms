# Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms using Scikit-Learn
The attached jupyter notebook documents observations in the varying strengths and weaknesses of four machine learning algorithms; Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

I compared the algorithms by testing their performance on classifying results for two unique problems. The first is a well-balanced [bioresponse dataset](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=4134&status=active) that represents a binary classification problem of whether or not a molecule will elicit a biological response based on various molecular features. The second is a moderately balanced [letter dataset](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=6&status=active) that represents a 26-class problem where each record is assigned a letter in the english alphabet based on pixel display features.

By adjusting model hyperparameters, we were able to observe changes in performance using validation curves, learning curves, wall-clock time and loss curves where applicable. The analysis was performed in python 3.7 using the scikit-learn (sklearn) package, version 1.2.1. The db folder contains an sqlite database with data for running the code without the time and space complexity of building and testing the models. To build the models instead of reading from database, change "read_db" to False in all calls to plot_validation_curve and plot_learning_curve.
